* Shoud I use mergeMap or  concatMap or switchMap or forkJoin for my usecase? 

> *Short Answer*: concatMap for writes, mergeMap for reads, switchMap when you have to cancel http call.  
 
> TL;DR: mergeMap doesnâ€™t preserve the order, concatMap does preserve the order. 
switchMap cancels previous inner Observables when a new inner Observable appears
