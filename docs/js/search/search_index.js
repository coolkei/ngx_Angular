As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\nHow can I help?\nFound an Issue?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can\nsubmit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHubfor an open or closed PR\nthat relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\n\nFollow our Coding Rules.\nRun the full Angular CLI test suite, and ensure that all tests pass.\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions\nis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n   git commit -aNote: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\nPush your branch to GitHub:\n  git push origin my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to ngx-starter-kit:master.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nMake the required updates.\nRe-run the Angular CLI test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:\n  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the master branch:\n  git checkout master -f\nDelete the local branch:\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\n  git pull --ff upstream master\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the Angular change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies\nci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\nperf: A code change that improves performance\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\nsemi-colons, etc)\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nJust as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\nFooter should contain a closing reference to an issue if any.\nSamples: (even more samples)\ndocs(changelog): update change log to beta.5fix(dependencies): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js\n\nThe version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
