# OIDC


> Redirect behaviour after `login()` and `logout()`

1. if `postLoginRedirectUri` is provided then `login()` call without `args`, will redirect to this URL after successful login.
2. if `postLogoutRedirectUri` is provided then `logout()` call without `args`, will redirect to this URL after successful logout.
3. if both of the above urls are configured, but if  `redirectUri` is  provided, will redirect to this URL after successful login and logout.
4. if non of the above urls are configured, will redirect to `currentUrl`  after successful login and logout.
5. always  `args` in `login()` and `logout()` take priority. 

> if the above URLs are relative URLs, then, the `OIDC Provider` may prepend `baseUrl` configured in `OIDC Provider`.
